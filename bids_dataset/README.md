This dataset was generated using the experiment script at https://github.com/apex-lab/ecg-rivalry-experiment.

58 subjects with self-reported normal vision were recruited for credit from the Psychology department's SONA participant pool, but subjects 53 and 56 were lost due to a technical error and subjects 43 and 54 were dropped due to noncompliance or participant error. (54 kept randomly pressing response buttons throughout discrimination trials, and 43 accidentally used the down key instead of the right arrow key to indicate rivalry switches.) As a result, only the 54 remaining subjects are included in this BIDS-formatted dataset.

Please consult the [BIDS documentation](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for details on the dataset's organization.
