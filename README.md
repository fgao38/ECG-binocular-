## Dataset description:

~~This data-set contains a total of 58~~ This data-set contains a total of 54 participants'(4 were excluded due to error) information (each participant has a sub-folder).Each participant sub-folder contains 3 tsv files: discrimination.tsv, task-rivalry-01,task-rivalry-02. Discrimination contains participant's information on judging one's own heart-rate, whereas the task-rivalry01 and task-rivalry02 measures participant's performance on the binocular rivalry task.

## Overview of planned project:

  This study explores the interplay between interoceptive stimuli, specifically the heartbeat, and exteroceptive visual perception. While existing research showed the impact of external stimuli on bodily functions, this investigation delves into the reverse relationshipâ€”whether interoceptive stimuli, often inaccessible to conscious awareness, influence visual perception. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous electrical activity in the heart and gastrointestinal tract, sending messages to the brain and shaping cognition (Azzalini et al.,2019). Emotional states derived from interoception can alter our perception of the external world(Smith et al., 2017), exemplified by perceiving neutral stimuli as threatening during anxious states.
  Despite prior investigations, the visual aspect of interoceptive-exteroceptive interaction remains understudied. This research addresses this gap by employing a binocular rivalry paradigm (carmel et al.,2010), presenting competing visual stimuli with one synchronized to participants' real-time heartbeat. The objective is to examine if this synchronization influences the prioritization of visual stimuli in conscious awareness. Building on earlier findings, we hypothesize that stimuli matching the participant's heartbeat will dominate the visual field for longer durations. Importantly, we anticipate this effect to persist irrespective of participants' conscious awareness of their heartbeat sensations.
  This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes underlying perception and consciousness, particularly in the context of visual bistable perceptual switching. The findings hold potential implications for elucidating the mechanisms through which the brain resolves perceptual ambiguities, shedding light on fundamental aspects of human perception.
