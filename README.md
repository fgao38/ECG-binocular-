# ECG-binocular-

## Dataset description:

~~This data-set contains a total of 58~~ This data-set contains a total of 54 participants'(4 were excluded due to error) information (each participant has a sub-folder).Each participant sub-folder contains 3 tsv files: discrimination.tsv, task-rivalry-01,task-rivalry-02. Discrimination contains participant's information on judging one's own heart-rate, whereas the task-rivalry01 and task-rivalry02 measures participant's performance on the binocular rivalry task.

## Overview of planned project:

We are specifically going to investigate: 1. Whether the duration of synchronous and unsynchronous viewing time differ, is measured through a **binocular rivalry task**, I have extracted all participants' performance on this task and placed them into the folder "Binocular_rivalry". 2. Whether participants can sense their heartbeat, is measured through a discrimination task, I have extracted all the discrimination files and placed them into a folder named "discrimination"

## File tree

1.  I am going to place all my data into a folder called "bids_data_set"
2.  I am going to place all my Papaja/script files into another folder named "script"
3.  I am probably create another folder to store my cheat_sheet named "cheat_sheet"
4.  I may create another folder to store my MAPSS 30550 assignments
