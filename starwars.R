# Assignment part 2

# Did you use the best kind of plot to tell the story youâ€™re hoping to tell?
# 1. Yes, I believed I have created the plot that I want. A plot for the substracted mean difference and a plot
# for average comparison between syn and asyn

# Did you have to do some wonky wrangling to plot what you wanted?
# I did some wrangling to the plot that I wanted, espically I have to readjust my data frames. 

# Are there adjustments you could make to scale, coord, or labs layers that would make things easier to read?
# I think the adjustments that I currently have is easier enough to read, I have shorten my x-axis to be 
# just right. 

#Are you effectively making use of groups? Could you communicate your point better by grouping in a different way (e.g., color, shape, fill, facet)? Add code to one chunk created in Assignment (10)
# Yes, in my histogram, I created a new dataframe named average_diff that grouped subject and calculate the mean duration
# that the participant spent on syn and asyn.
